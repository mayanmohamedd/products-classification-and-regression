	Project Objectives:
 1. Apply Image preprocessing or Feature Extraction techniques where needed.
                2. Train at least one classification model to determine the product category. 
 3. Train a one/few shot learning model (e.g., Siamese) to verify if a product exists and recognize its type.
	Classification Steps:
1.	 Traditional Approaches:  Bag of Virtual Words for feature extraction. 
2.	Classification: SVM classifier (80% accuracy). 
3.	Enhanced Model: Alex Net Model (88% accuracy)
	Recognition Steps:
1.	- Recognition Technique: Siamese Model (92% accuracy)
	Test Script: This script tests an image classification model on unseen data. Classification part measures accuracy, while Recognition Part classifies images based on similarity to existing or new products.
